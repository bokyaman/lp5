//This program performs **parallel computations** on an array of integers to find the **minimum**, **maximum**, **sum**, and **average** of its elements using **OpenMP** for parallel processing. Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of what each part of the program does:

### Key Concepts:

1. **OpenMP**: 
   - This is a library used for **parallel programming**. It allows the program to run multiple tasks at the same time, making operations faster when there are many tasks (like processing a large array).

2. **Reduction**:
   - A reduction is a technique used in parallel programming where each thread computes part of a result and then combines those results. In this program, we use **OpenMP reduction** to safely calculate the **minimum**, **maximum**, **sum**, and **average** without data conflicts between multiple threads.

### Breakdown of the Program:

#### 1. **min_reduction** Function (Finds Minimum Value):
   - The program initializes `min_value` to the largest possible integer (`INT_MAX`).
   - It uses the `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(min: min_value)` directive to parallelize the loop that checks each element of the array.
   - Each thread looks at parts of the array and updates the `min_value` if it finds a smaller value.
   - After all threads have finished, the smallest value is printed.

#### 2. **max_reduction** Function (Finds Maximum Value):
   - The program initializes `max_value` to the smallest possible integer (`INT_MIN`).
   - Similar to the `min_reduction` function, this one uses `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(max: max_value)` to parallelize the loop and find the largest value in the array.
   - It prints the largest value after all threads finish their work.

#### 3. **sum_reduction** Function (Finds Sum of Elements):
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0.
   - It uses `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+: sum)` to parallelize the loop and accumulate the sum of all array elements.
   - Once all threads are done, the sum is printed.

#### 4. **average_reduction** Function (Finds Average Value):
   - This function also calculates the sum of the array using parallel reduction, just like `sum_reduction`.
   - After the sum is calculated, the average is computed by dividing the sum by the number of elements (`n`).
   - The average is then printed.

#### 5. **main** Function:
   - The user is prompted to enter the number of elements (`n`) in the array.
   - The program dynamically allocates memory for the array (`arr`) and takes user input for the array elements.
   - The program then calls the four functions (`min_reduction`, `max_reduction`, `sum_reduction`, and `average_reduction`) to perform the calculations.
   - Finally, the allocated memory for the array is freed using `delete[]`.

### Example:
1. **Input**:
   ```
   Enter total number of elements => 5
   Enter elements => 10 5 20 15 30
   ```

2. **Output**:
   ```
   Minimum value: 5
   Maximum value: 30
   Sum: 80
   Average: 16
   ```

### Why Use OpenMP Here?
- **OpenMP** allows us to **parallelize** the calculations, meaning the program can potentially perform the operations faster, especially if the array size is large and there are multiple CPU cores available.

### Summary:
- The program takes an array of numbers, then **parallelizes** the calculations to find the **minimum**, **maximum**, **sum**, and **average** of the array elements using **OpenMP reduction**.
- This method ensures that the program works efficiently, utilizing multiple CPU cores for faster processing when handling large arrays.
